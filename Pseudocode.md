## The total number of months included in the datasheet 
-Because every array in the finances virable represent a month. it best to use the .length property to deisplay the total amount of months.


* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
-The approach is to calculate the total sum for each year using the for loop and the addition properties 
- create a variable for each year, and within that add the area of the total figures for every month 
   - each figure will represent a month
   - use the for loop to calculate the total profit/loss for each year
   -repeat this step for every year
